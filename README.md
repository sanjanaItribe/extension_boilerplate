# Creating cross browser extensions using WebExtension API and React JS

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### Testing for extension

Install the project locally like any react project.

To check the extension up and running in browsers(chrome and firefox) run `npm run build` command and paste the
`manifest.json` file from `extras` to `build` folder.

For Google Chrome -> Select the `build` folder while testing the extension. \
For Firefox -> Select the `manifest.json` from the `build` folder. \
